locker_room,"battle_room,atrium","As you step into the locker room, you can smell the odor of stale sweat, almost like fried chicken, entering your nostrils. You can hear running water to your left – must be the showers. After the incident between the Salamander commander and the whiz kid, most cadets are preferring to head back to the dorms to shower. Haunted? No. Bad vibes? Definitely."
mess_hall,atrium,"Napolean once said that “an army marches on its stomach,” and the wisdom of those words hasn't changed over the ages. Rows and rows of identical, beige tables fall out on your right and left side. On the far end, you can see the empty serving stations, and on the left wall, you can see the standings of the various armies. Salamander's doing strong, as is Rat. But what's this Dragon army? You've never heard of them and yet they've been climbing quickly. You'll need to ask around to find out."
atrium,"locker_room,mess_hall,lecture_hall","You step into a grand atrium with a hemispherical glass ceiling and a circle of glass inset in the center of the floor to match. Looking up, you see the moon. Looking down, the earth. A chill runs down your spine, even after all these years. That blue marble is what we're all here to protect from oblivion. Better get moving."
lecture_hall,atrium,"A lecture hall? Well, they call it Battle SCHOOL, after all. This is the main lecture hall where the cadets are taught space tactics, military history, and engineering. It's also the room that Graff uses when we wants to address all the cadets. “If only we took his words to heart,” you mutter to yourself."
battle_room,locker_room,"The battle room. Unfortunately, it's off limits when a battle is not in session. You walk up next to the blast-door and peer in through the reinforced glass aside it. It's hard to make out shapes in the dimly-lit space, but you clearly see the silhouettes of an assortment of square cubes, eerily suspended in zero gravity. Looking past the cubes, you're able to see the enemy's gate, glowing faintly in the distance. "
